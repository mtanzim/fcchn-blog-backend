# MERN Stack Dynamic Application

## Overview

Fullstack application being developed for educational purposes, using the MERN stack.
create-react-app (CRA) boilerplate was used.

This project has been converted using CRA from the following FCC Hanoi Front End Project:

## Project 3: Dynamic Blogging App

### Objectives

* Collaborate with developers to design, and deploy a full stack MERN app.
* Practice open source developement, learning to read code and documentation
* Take existing code, and evolve it to acoomplish required user stories
* Develop a deep understanding of technologies such as node, react, redux, mongoose, mongo, and express
* Learn to select and utlize front end npm libraries such as redux-promise, redux-form, redux-thunk etc.
  * Learn and practice optimistic state updates with redux promise
  * Practice debug with chrome developer tools
  * Learn to develop custom redux middleware (logging, error reporting)
  * Learn methods to keep authentication in sync with the back end
  * Practice ES6 syntax (promises, object/string literals)
* Learn to select and utlize back end npm libraries such as express, mongoose, mocha, babel etc.
  * Learn to develop custom middleware
  * Learn to use passport for authentication
  * Learn unit testing with Mocha
  * Learn to use Mongoose for API/datbase control
* Practice developing, debugging, testing, and finally deploying a full stack application

## Next Steps

* Revisit older projects and apply learnings for code optimizations and readbility
* Continue practicing es6 syntax, and become more familiar with async code
* Learn JWT Authentication
* Become more comfortable with database controllers
* Practice using SQL databases with nodeJS
